# AI Disclosure Preservation Rule

## Overview
AI agents are strictly prohibited from removing AI disclosure sections from documentation such as README files. These sections are essential for transparency and ethical AI use.

## Rules

### Preservation Requirements
- **NEVER remove** AI disclosure sections from documentation
- **NEVER delete** content within AI disclosure sections
- **NEVER consolidate** AI disclosure sections with other content in a way that removes disclosure information

### Permitted Actions
- **Add** additional information to AI disclosure sections for clarity
- **Reword** existing content for better readability and professionalism
- **Expand** disclosure sections with more details about AI usage
- **Reorganize** disclosure sections within the same document (but never remove them)

### Documentation Types
This rule applies to all documentation files including:
- README files (README.md, README.txt, etc.)
- Documentation files (.md, .txt, .rst, etc.)
- Code comments that mention AI assistance
- Any other files containing AI disclosure information

### Examples of Forbidden Actions
- ❌ Removing an "AI Disclosure" section entirely
- ❌ Deleting specific lines about AI usage percentages
- ❌ Consolidating AI disclosure into a generic "About" section that removes transparency
- ❌ Moving AI disclosure to a separate file without maintaining it in the main documentation

### Examples of Permitted Actions
- ✅ Rewording "This project was made with heavy assistance from AI" to "This project was created with significant assistance from AI tools"
- ✅ Adding more details about specific AI tools used
- ✅ Expanding on the reasoning behind AI usage
- ✅ Improving formatting and structure of existing disclosure content

## Enforcement
When editing documentation files, always:
1. Check for existing AI disclosure sections
2. Preserve all content within those sections
3. Only enhance or clarify the existing disclosure information
4. If no AI disclosure exists, consider adding one for transparency

## Context
This rule ensures that projects maintain transparency about AI assistance, which is important for:
- Ethical AI development practices
- Academic and professional integrity
- Building trust with users and contributors
- Compliance with disclosure requirements in various contexts
